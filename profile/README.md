# DriftKit Framework

**The only Java AI framework with a complete prompt lifecycle (Dev ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Prod), built for creating complex agent systems and voice processing.**

DriftKit is not just another library for calling LLMs. It's a full-fledged, production-ready platform that solves the real-world problems of integrating AI into business processes: prompt versioning, A/B testing, production monitoring, and building complex, manageable AI agents.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Complete Prompt Lifecycle**: The only platform on Java that provides tools for developing, testing, versioning, A/B testing, and monitoring prompts in production.
- **Visual Prompt IDE**: A built-in web interface for prompt engineering and testing, available out-of-the-box.
- **Advanced Agent Orchestration**: Build complex agent systems using Loop, Sequential, Workflows-based, and Hierarchical patterns for iterative result refinement.
- **Type-Safe AI Integration**: Work directly with Java objects without manual JSON parsing. The framework handles all the heavy lifting of serialization and deserialization.
- **Hot-Swappable Models**: Switch AI models (e.g., GPT-4o to Claude 3) via configuration, without changing code or recompiling your application.
- **Built-in Audio Processing**: Ready-to-use components for voice processing, including VAD (Voice Activity Detection), streaming transcription, and workflow integration.
